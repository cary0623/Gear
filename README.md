# Introduction
Gear introduces a blockchain-based decentralized AI agent network, merging AI and web3 to foster a secure, transparent ecosystem for permissionless intelligent services and financial operations, enabling modular, Lego-like connections between AI agents and smart contracts.

# Our vision
**Building the LEGO of Decentralized AI on Solana.**

Imagine AI, Web3, and blockchain not as separate things, but like LEGO bricks. They can be put together to access full AI services. That's what Gear is about. It’s like a LEGO box for tech, It opens new income ways for service providers and brings financial innovation to join in AI and blockchain.
# Target User
Gear target user include developers who create AI Agent services to make Web3 reward
and include users who called AI services with high demand.
The third are service providers, offering blockchain and storage infrastructure, Like Solana And Arweave. its crucial to our ecosystem. 
Together these groups form the main of Gear’s community.

# Long Term Vision
Our platform's essence is "composability." In two ways:

**Process Composability**: Users can, like building with LEGO,stitch together different AI services into a workflow through smart contract calls. This method opens up a new domain of decentralised AI Agents.

**Financial Composability**: On the gear platform, each AI service can be encapsulated into NFT. This means that AI service providers can  engage in financial activities through the NFT market. We Call this "decentralised AI Finance," 

We aim to lead and change the DeAIFi LEGO world on Solana.

# Module

## Gear-Server
This repository is the server code for the Gear project. The server-side operates as a crucial hub for gear management, facilitating both the creation and invocation phases. It also plays a critical role in third-party call handling, parsing user inputs and returned data effectively. With Arweave integration, operational excellency is ensured, as an on-chain evidence system oversees all procedures. This storeroom of functionalities streams together the comprehensive landscape of our project's server component.

## Gear-Contract
This repository is the contract code for the Gear project. The contract hanlde the instructions from both user and creators, and ensure the transactions execution invoke successed.
